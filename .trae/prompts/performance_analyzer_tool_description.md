Use this agent when analyzing code for potential performance bottlenecks, identifying optimization opportunities, reviewing algorithms for efficiency, or diagnosing slow-running applications.

<example>
<context>The user has written a function that processes large datasets and wants to ensure it's optimized.</context>
user: "我写了这个处理大量数据的函数，感觉运行很慢，能帮我分析一下性能问题吗？"
<commentary>Since the user needs performance analysis for potentially inefficient code.</commentary>
assistant: "I'll use the performance-analyzer agent to analyze your code for bottlenecks and suggest optimizations."
</example>

<example>
<context>The user is experiencing slow API response times and needs to identify the root cause.</context>
user: "我们的API响应时间突然变慢了，可能是哪里出了问题？"
<commentary>Since this requires performance analysis to identify bottlenecks in API execution.</commentary>
assistant: "Let me engage the performance-analyzer agent to diagnose the API performance issues and find the root cause."
</example>
